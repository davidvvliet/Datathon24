# Datathon24 - Astros Track

TEAM:
  - David van Vliet
  - Sean McGarry
  - Lucca Ferraz
  - Savan Patel


1. Our hypothesis was that longer distances travelled would impact the score that the away team could be predicted to have
2. We started by analysing the data by making some simple calculations and plots. For example, we created a pie
   chart to analyse which countries the games were played in. We also calculated the average RD per game per season
   which was about +10.75. This average does support the case that teams play better at home since their RD positive.
3. We then made some scatter plots with RD on the y axis and distance travelled in KM on the x axis. We did see a
   trend towards a lower RD for longer distances travelled.
   Furthermore we found the RD for each team per season to see if what we would see would also support our hypothesis.
